# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

A scientific article i wrote on "Linear Time Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms" for my MSc course on Data Structures and Algorithms at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. 

**Abstract**

The problem considered here is that of find ing a minimum spanning tree in a connected graph . Two algorithms with linear time time complexity have been
presented in the minimum spanning tree problem history, a randomized linear time algorithm was presented in 1995 by Karger, Klein and Tarjan, and a linear time
deterministic algorithm was presented in 2000 by Chazelle.
